    <h2 id="intro-me"> About me: </h2>
    <p> MSc in Astrophysics, in my thesis I worked on structure formation within the spherical collapse framework by considering scalar-tensor theories as substitutes for Dark Energy.  </p>
    <p> I am also a former basketball coach for youth teams in Oslo. </p>
    <p> At the moment my interests ranges from hiking, through physics and weight lifting to programing. I recently did some Khan Academy courses on the use of HTML/CSS. </p>
